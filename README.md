# Personal Assistant with Memory

This Jupyter Notebook implements a personal assistant that can serve as both a helpful research companion and a friendly assistant. It utilizes memory to retain information about the user, enabling personalized interactions over time.

## Features
- **User Memory**: Remembers past interactions and details about the user to provide context-aware responses.
- **Research Assistance**: Helps in organizing, summarizing, and retrieving research materials based on user queries.
- **Conversational Friend**: Engages in meaningful and contextually relevant conversations, adapting to the user’s preferences.
- **Task Management**: Keeps track of user-defined tasks, reminders, and follow-ups to enhance productivity.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores user data for long-term memory and continuity across sessions.

## Libraries Used
### 1. OpenAI
- **Purpose**: Provides access to GPT models for generating conversational responses.
- **Usage**:
  - Generates text-based responses based on user input.
  - Helps in research assistance by summarizing and explaining topics.
  - Enhances conversational ability by fine-tuning prompts and responses.

### 2. LangChain
- **Purpose**: Manages conversation memory and organizes interactions efficiently.
- **Usage**:
  - Maintains a history of past conversations to enable contextual continuity.
  - Integrates various memory components, ensuring the assistant recalls key details over time.
  - Enables structured responses by chaining different language models and APIs together.

### 3. Transformers
- **Purpose**: Provides pre-trained language models that can be leveraged for text processing and NLP tasks.
- **Usage**:
  - Supports integration with additional language models beyond OpenAI.
  - Enhances natural language processing tasks such as summarization and text generation.
  - Can be fine-tuned for improved performance in specific use cases.

### 4. Letta
- **Purpose**: Implements an advanced memory retention system to track and recall user interactions.
- **Usage**:
  - Maintains long-term memory persistence across multiple sessions.
  - Ensures that responses remain personalized based on prior user queries.
  - Organizes memory in an efficient format to allow retrieval of key information when needed.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install openai langchain transformers letta
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook memory2_openai.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to initialize and interact with the assistant.
3. Enter your queries to start interacting with the assistant.
4. The assistant will use memory to improve interactions over time.

## Customization
- Modify the memory storage format to better fit your use case.
- Extend the assistant’s capabilities by integrating it with external APIs such as Google Calendar or note-taking applications.
- Adjust prompt engineering techniques to refine response quality.

## Future Enhancements
- **Voice Interaction**: Implement speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities to enable voice-based communication.
- **Multi-User Support**: Introduce separate user profiles for individualized memory retention.
- **Advanced Research Features**: Integrate automatic document summarization, citation generation, and knowledge graph linking.
- **Integration with External Apps**: Enable connectivity with task managers, calendars, and cloud-based storage solutions for seamless workflow management.
